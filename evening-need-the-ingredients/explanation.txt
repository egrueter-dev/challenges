Lesson Explanation:

1. I initiated telnet like so:
  telnet localhost 4567 on the running Sinatra server

2.Once telnet was initiated, I specified the file I want to POST to
  POST /ingredients HTTP/1.1

3. I specified the host:
  Host:localhost

4. Then indicated the content length
  Content-Length: 29

5. I broke up the new data, separating the content with a "+"
  ingredient=3/4+teaspoon+kosher+salt
