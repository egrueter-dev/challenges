# YOUR CODE HERE

# Write a program to simulate the game show and report how
# often each the user guesses correctly. The program should
# simulate two different scenarios: one where the user switches
# doors and another when the user doesn't. The simulation
# should be run **n** times where **n** is passed as a
# command-line argument (i.e. `ruby monty_hall.rb 100`
# should run the simulation 100 times). Print out the outcomes for
# both scenarios as a percentage of games guessed correctly.


trans = { :amount => 2000.00, :description => "payday!", :date => Date.new(2013, 6, 26) }
# trans[:amount]
puts trans["amount"]
